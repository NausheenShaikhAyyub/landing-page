        </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Coding is the process of translating instructions from our language to the computer’s language. Specifically, machine language is written in binary terms (0s and 1s), so coders write their word-based instructions into an applicable format that the computer understands.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Learning to code is no longer a “speciality” skill. Rather, it has become a mainstream, core discipline utilized in nearly every industry; requiring more and more skilled workers every year.
        Coding tests a variety of abilities. It hones problem-solving and analysis skills, such as finding errors and thinking logically. Further, coding often helps people develop teamwork and interpersonal skills since software and application projects are often cross-disciplinary and collaborative.
        Perhaps coding’s biggest attraction is that almost anyone can learn it. Aspiring coders don’t necessarily need to be experts in math or have vast prior experience.</p>
